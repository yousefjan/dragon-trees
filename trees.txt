Comm:

 Welcome to the DTIFS compiler sorce-code, first example first edition.

 The compiler is quite primitive and does not like a lot of things. In many cases it
 will give an error-message but not in all. Try to stick to the styles of coding used
 here and it will most likeley work fine for you =)

 SunCode May 2005.

 Note that:

  	This file may not exeed the size of 32,000 bytes.

  	This file may not contain more than 31 trees but less is OK, the compiler sets
	the rest to "The Dummy Tree!". (The DTIFS tool uses max 32 trees and tree #00
	is reserved for the "Random tree".)

	All keywords are case sensitive.

	All assignments must have a space on both sides of the assignment character,
	example: "Keyword = value" is good, "Keyword=value" is no good. (The both spaces
	and the assignment cahracter " = " are actually parts of the keyword, hard-coded.)

	The "Name" must use double qoutation-marks ( " ).
        Also: the name may not exeed the size of 15 chars.

	Try to keep the postes separated by a "white char", (space or line-feed)
	else the result is not guaranteed, (it works in most cases but looks awful =)

	All keywords in the header must be there, non of them is optional.

	The number of "Branches" used for the tree is a integer number, (use 2-8).

	All flags "Use heights", "Global scale", "Scale by height" and "Use twist"
	uses boolean logics, use 0 or 1 for these.

	All the outher parameters are in floating point format, (it is alsoe possible
	to use the exponent form if one likes).

	If the flag "Use heights" is set to 0 (zero), then the heights are optional
	(actually ignored if they are there anyway).

	The "Stem" does not use "Height", for that the height in the header is used.
	The height of the branches are parts of the height of the stem. Examples:
	1.0 = top of stub, 0.5 = half way up.

	If the flag "Global scale" is set to 1, then the scale given for the "Stem"
	is used for all branches. (ignored if they are there anyway).

	The flag "Scale by height" does not affect the compiler and is only used for
	rendering the tree.

	If the flag "Use twist" is set to 0 (zero) then the "Twist" angle is optional
	(and if there, ignored by the compiler).

	All branches must "Lean" and "Rotate" - no options.

	All trees must have a "Stem" and at least one "Branch", (it's useless to try
	to create a fractal from using only one attractor :)

	The height of the "Stub" (in the header) must be a negative value or else
	the tree will grow downvards, (a root system ?). This is due to a fundamental
	error in the renderer that I have not yet fixed, (coz it does not matter much).

Comm: This tree uses the most compact listing-mode I allowe :), you can write the posts unseparated, ( like this: Scale = 0.6666666Lean = 60.0Rotate = 0.0 ) but this makes the code more than hard to read. It is recomended to use the structured-one assignment per line-mode, (used in the first examples or below) it looks best. (Even this example is way to messy for me =). EndComm
